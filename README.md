# go-dynamic
dynamic programming showcase in Golang.

## Dynamic Programming (recursion + memoization + guessing)
- momoize (remember) & re-use solutions to subproblem that help solve the problem.
- time = #subproblems * time/subproblem. i.e: in fib, time/subprob = O(1), don't count recursion.


### GUessing:
- Don't know the answer? guess.
- try all guesses! (& take the best one)
